# Wrapper for running calamares on Debian live media

# Modified by Thomas Castleman {contact@draugeros.org} for use with Drauger OS

# Access control to run calamares as root for xwayland
# Doing the above isn't really necessary but we do it anyways
#  in case someone has the stupid idea to replace X11 with Wayland (Seriously, don't use Wayland for gaming.)
